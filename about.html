            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>Paycheck Clarity is a free, 100% private take-home pay calculator designed to help you quickly understand what you'll actually earn from your salary or hourly wage.</p>

            <h3>Why We Built This</h3>
            <p>Understanding your paycheck can be confusing. Between gross pay, taxes, deductions, and varying pay frequencies, it's easy to feel lost. We created Paycheck Clarity to make this simple:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fast:</strong> Get an instant estimate of your take-home pay in seconds.</li>
                <li><strong>Private:</strong> All calculations happen in your browser—we never collect, store, or sell your data.</li>
                <li><strong>Accurate:</strong> Based on commonly used tax rates and deduction logic, giving you a reliable estimate.</li>
                <li><strong>Free:</strong> No signup, no ads (except optional ad placeholders), no tricks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>The calculator is straightforward. Enter your hourly rate or annual salary, select your pay frequency, choose your state, set your estimated tax rate, and click "Calculate." In an instant, you'll see:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your gross pay per period</li>
                <li>Estimated taxes</li>
                <li>Your take-home pay (net pay)</li>
                <li>Estimated annual and monthly net income</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Important Disclaimers</h3>
            <p>Paycheck Clarity is a tool for estimation purposes only. It is <strong>not</strong> financial or tax advice. Your actual take-home pay may vary based on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your specific W-4 withholdings</li>
                <li>Additional deductions and benefits</li>
                <li>State and local tax laws</li>
                <li>Your filing status and dependents</li>
                <li>Bonuses, overtime, and other income</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For accurate tax information, please consult with a qualified tax professional or accountant.</p>
