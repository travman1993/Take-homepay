            <h4>3. Data Processing</h4>
            <p>Any data you enter into the calculator (salary, hourly rate, hours worked, deductions) is processed entirely within your browser's memory. Once you close the page or refresh, this data is immediately cleared. No data is saved, transmitted, or stored on our servers.</p>
